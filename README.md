# node-horoscope-generator

A Node.js app that uses the OpenAI API to create a horoscope and then outputs it as a markdown file.

## Installation

1. Open the terminal, navigate to a suitable install location, and then **clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/fermentationist/node-horoscope-generator.git`**.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the app (`cd node-horoscope-generator`), then **`npm install`**.
3. Next you need to **create a file to store environment variables**. It should be named `.env`. (Starting the filename with a `.` might cause the file to be hidden in your OS's file system, so you might need to enable viewing hidden files.) **You may do this by copying and renaming `example_env` with the command `cp example_env .env`**. 
4. You will need to **set an environment variable in your `.env` file named `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key**, like `OPENAI_API_KEY = <your key>`. You may also set an output directory in which to save files, using the `NHG_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` environment variable. If you copied the `example_env` file in the previous step, just add you API key to the existing variable. Also note that `.env` is already included in the `.gitignore` file, so you don't need to worry about accidentally committing your API key to the repository.

## Use (command-line)

- To create a new horoscope for the current date, from the root folder of the app, run **`node createHoroscope.js`**.
- If you would like to generate a horoscope for a specific date other than today, add the date, in YYYY-MM-DD format: **`node createHoroscope.js <date>`**.
- Another parameter may be added to adjust the "temperature" of the response. This temperature parameter is a number between 0 and 2, that controls how "creative" the output is (this is a feature of the OpenAI API). It is set to 1 by default.  A higher number will result in more "creative" (and possibly nonsensical) output. **`node createHoroscope.js <date> <temperature>`**
- Generated horoscopes will be saved to the directory defined in the `NHG_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` environment variable (or else in `/temp/`) as `<date>.md`.

## Use (module)

```javascript
import { createHoroscope, createHoroscopeAndSaveToFile } from "./createHoroscope.js";

// generate today's horoscope as a text string
const todayHoroscope = await createHoroscope();

// generate a horoscope for a specific date as a text string
const horoscope = await createHoroscope({date: "1999-12-31"});

// -or-

// generate a horoscope and save to disk as markdown file (optional temperature parameter also used here)
await createHoroscopeAndSaveToFile({date: "1999-12-31", temperature: 1.1});

```
